The Titanic was on a ship bound for New York City on April 15, 1912, when it collided with an iceberg and caused many deaths. An estimated 2,224 passengers and crew were on board. More than 1,500 of them died. When the Titanic entered service, it was the largest ship.

The main purpose of this notebook is to show how machine learning models can help us predict passenger survival. You can use this notebook to learn the basics of machine learning in Python. 

The model which I trained helps me be on the top 4% on Kaggle.com Leaderboard with an accuracy score of 0.80382 on competition test dataset.
